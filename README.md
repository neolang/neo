<h1>NEO Programming Language</h1>

NEO `νεο` Is a Statically Typed Programming Language With a Self-Compiler, Transpiled To C, and Uses `.n`/`.v` As File Extensions. It Is Fast, Easy, Safe and Designed For Developing Maintainable Software. The Compiler Is Self-Hosted and Written In `NEO` ItSelf. You Will Need a C Compiler Installed and Available In Your `PATH` To Be Able To Compile NEO Programs.

The prefix [NEO](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/neo-), derived from the Ancient Greek [`νεο`](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%BF-)/[`νέος`](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BD%CE%AD%CE%BF%CF%82) (néo/néos), meaning 'new/modern', encapsulates the spirit of innovation. It symbolizes our commitment to providing a cutting-edge, forward-thinking technology with the [`NEO`](https://github.com/neolang/neo) programming language. This language is designed for developers seeking modern, efficient, and robust software solutions. For more about the significance of 'NEO', visit [Wikipedia](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/neo-).

The NEO programming language utilizes `.n` and `.v` as its file extensions. These choices are deeply rooted in the language's identity—`.n` is derived from the first letter of `NEO`, emphasizing the language's modern capabilities, while `.v` comes from the first letter of the Greek spelling `νεο`, reflecting the original linguistic heritage. This thoughtful naming underscores NEO’s blend of innovation and tradition, making it a distinctive tool in software development:
* `.n` is taken from the first letter of `NEO`, highlighting the language's modern capabilities.
* `.v` is derived from the first letter of the Greek spelling `νεο`, reflecting its original linguistic heritage.
* Together, `.n`/`.v` underscore NEO’s unique blend of innovation and tradition, marking it as a distinctive tool in software development.

The domain `neolang.nl` creatively abbreviates the name of the NEO programming language, where `nl` stands for the first letters of `NEO` and `lang`, highlighting its unique identity and focus:
* `n` is taken from `neo`
* `l` is taken from `lang`
* `nl` highlights the unique identity of `neolang`
